\section{Other Forms of Reuse}
\label{sec-other}

The combination of low price and many capabilities makes discarded phones
suitable for many other forms of reuse. With their GPS chips, discarded
smartphones can easily replace dedicated car GPS navigation units costing
hundreds of dollars. By utilizing their on-board storage, discarded
smartphones could be a part of a personal storage cloud by serving as powered
storage lockers, caching media and shared files close to the user's primary
device at home, at work, or while in the car. Programmable thermostats that
look much like smartphones cost hundreds of dollars, despite the fact that
smartphones have temperature sensors and Wifi and represent a much cheaper
option. And discarded iPhones are already getting second lives as
motion-triggered security cameras through the use of the popular Presence
app~\cite{presence-peoplepower}.

Another option is to use discarded phones to create storage clusters similar
to the FAWN~\cite{fawn} fast array of wimpy nodes. Discarded smartphones have
many similarities in terms of processing power, memory, and storage with the
devices used by FAWN, combined with a considerable advantage in price, and
could be used to create Fast Arrays of Discarded Smartphones (FADS).

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusion}

To conclude, we believe that the millions of discarded smartphones represent
a significant opportunity, and can be used in many cases as replacements for
sensor nodes in our effort to better instrument the world around us. Through
intelligent reuse, we can turn techno trash into treasure.
