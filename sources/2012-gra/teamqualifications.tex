\section{Investigator Qualifications}
\label{sec-qualifications}

Geoffrey Challen has deployed sensor networks on active
volcanos~\cite{volcano-osdi06}, developed new solutions for managing energy
in distributed systems~\cite{lance-sensys08,idea-mobisys10}, and is currently
building a 750~phone public participatory smartphone testbed called
\textsc{PhoneLab} at SUNY Buffalo. The challenges inherent to smartphone
recycling lie in the intersection of his previous work on sensing, his
current work on smartphones, and his developing interests in sustainability
and infrastructure. Through the Google- and NSF-funded \textsc{PhoneLab}
project he has developed local contacts at Sprint necessary to the success of
the proposed research.
