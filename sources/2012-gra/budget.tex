Our budget includes support for two graduate research assistants. Students
will be assigned recycling projects based on their interests and will also be
engaged in proposing new ideas of how to reuse discarded smartphones. For
phones we will reuse the 40 phones we received from Google last year through
the University Award program. Given that one requirement of this project is
determining how to provide power for recycled smartphones deployed in areas
were power infrastructure is not available, we budget a small amount of
equipment money to purchase 20 Nexus S solar panel chargers for outdoor use.
