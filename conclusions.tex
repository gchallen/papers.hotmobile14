\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec-conclusions}

Smartphone fitting produces new requirements for existing tracing techniques
while raising new questions for systems design. We are working on augmenting
existing \PhoneLab{} experiments to collect data on all aspects of smartphone
usage variation---including processor and memory usage, currently difficult to observe. But we believe that this vision is sound and solves the two parts
of this interconnected problem together: better-designed choices, and
better decision-making tools. We are excited to see what smartphones will be
like once they are designed and personalized by users.
