\section{Motes v. Discarded Phones}
\label{sec-comparison}

As part of determining whether discarded smartphones can replace sensor motes
for some sensor networking applications, we perform an attribute-by-attribute
comparison of the two options. We compare \XXXnote{FIXME} sensor node
platforms with one discarded phone, the Samsung Nexus S 4G model that was
used for our preliminary feasibility study. Table~\ref{FIXME} presents
numbers used in the discussion below, drawn from both datasheets and
experiments.

\subsection{Cost and Availability}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Packaging and Human Interface}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Sensors and Sensor Interface}

Overally, difficulties with operating in USB host mode prevent discarded
phones from fully taking advantage of their ubiquitous micro-USB interface.
\textbf{Advantage: even.}

\subsection{Programming Effort}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Computational Power}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Connectivity}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Power Consumption}

\textbf{Advantage: mote.}

\subsection{Ideal Uses}
