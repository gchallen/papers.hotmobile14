\section{Motes v. Discarded Phones}
\label{sec-comparison}

\input{./figures/devicetable.tex}

As part of determining whether discarded smartphones can replace sensor motes
for some sensor networking applications, we perform an attribute-by-attribute
comparison of the two options. We compare the Epic mote, a common sensor node
platform, with one discarded phone, the Samsung Nexus S 4G model that was
used for our preliminary feasibility study. Table~\ref{table-comparison}
presents numbers used in the discussion below, drawn from both datasheets and
experiments. As an additional comparison point, we also include numbers for
the Raspberry Pi Model B, since this is a popular, cheap and fairly-powerful
single-board computer.

\subsection{Cost and Availability}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Packaging and Human Interface}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}

\subsection{Sensors and Sensor Interface}

Overally, difficulties with operating in USB host mode prevent discarded
phones from fully taking advantage of their ubiquitous micro-USB interface.
\textbf{Advantage: even.}

\subsection{Programming Environment}

\textbf{Advantage: discarded smartphone.}
